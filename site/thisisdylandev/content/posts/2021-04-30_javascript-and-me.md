description: 'My feelings towards JavaScript as of late'

I may or may not be procrastinating finals right now.

Up until the past few weeks, I've always reached for JavaScript for my personal
projects. Things like React, Gatsby, and the MERN Stack have been my go-to tools
pretty much since I started developing software. Dabbling in React Native even
was super fun, and a really fun take on making a native app. I cut my teeth in
the industry on Xamarin making apps, so I have some opinions on app dev, and
React Native is just all around a great tool to work with, just like many of the
other tools in the JavaScript ecosystem.

However, I've learned something in the past... month or so. JavaScript fatigue
is a _very_ real thing. It's been exhausting keeping up with the community,
about the time I get a solid foundation on using a tool, _boom_ new tool who
dis? So, I decided I needed to take a break from JavaScript, but I still wanted
to work on my side projects.

After just taking some time away from side projects in general, I'm ready to
start a new project for my whole "12 Projects In A Year" goal. I've dabbled in a
few different pieces of tech, but one thing always stands out to me and I keep
going back to. Rails. Everything JavaScript lately touts itself as "the next
Rails" or "Ruby on Rails for JavaScript." So, seeing as I use Rails a lot at
work already, I figured it's about time I spent time doing some Rails work for
me. I signed up for a subscription to [GoRails](https://gorails.com/) (separate
blog post for that coming later), listened to a few podcasts, and discovered
that well.... even with all the _stuff_ going on, Rails is pretty awesome.

Oh also, I added an [RSS feed](https://www.ctrlaltdylan.com/rss.xml) to my blog,
feel free to subscribe in however you consume RSS feeds.

Well, that's all for now ðŸ‘‹
