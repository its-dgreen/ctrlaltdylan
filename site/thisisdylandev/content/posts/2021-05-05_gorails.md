I wrote recently on how I felt about JavaScript, and, to sum it up, JavaScript
and I are going to see other people for the time being. So, I took to Ruby and
Rails, amidst all the _stuff_ going on recently in the community. I use it a lot
at work, but figured it was a good time to just sit around and actually get good
at something other than JavaScript.

I took the [Learn Ruby on Rails for Beginners course](https://gorails.com/start)
at GoRails, even though I've already done a couple of "beginner Rails" courses
over on Udemy. Chris is a wonderful teacher, and his screencasts were the thing
I was looking for in a programming tutorial. We coded along and created a Tweet
Scheduler using Rails, and minimal gems. Instead of devise, we created auth so
we could get an understanding of what's going on under the hood. Chris really
took the time to explain everything along the way, from something really basic
to something more advanced like Sidekiq and background jobs. Honestly, I cannot
recommend GoRails enough if you are looking to learn more about Rails.

Chris has some lessons on the new hotness that is Hotwire, and I plan on
watching and coding along with all of them.

Well, that's all for now ðŸ‘‹
