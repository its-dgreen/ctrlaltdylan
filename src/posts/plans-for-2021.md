After watching [Ben Awad's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4jB2AYJWl0)
on his plans for 2021, I figure'd I would follow suit and write a blog post for
what I want to learn in 2021, and what I learned in 2020. For this list, I'm
defining "learned" as begin able to use something on my own, with minimal help
from stackoverflow.

## What I learned in 2020

I learned a lot in 2020, my current role really pushed me to learn things I
wouldn't have learned otherwise.

- Ruby on Rails

- Ansible

- Express

- Docker

- Gatsby

- MongoDB

Those last 2 I learned on my own time, but there absolutely great and I think
they're worth trying out.

## What I want to learn in 2021

Here it is, the big ole list of things I want to learn/use in 2021, pretty much
in the order I want to learn it

- Next.js

- Prisma

- Some fancy CSS technology like Chakra UI or Tailwind CSS

- Dynamic apps in Gatsby

- Definitely want to do more with TypeScript

And there you have it, that's my learning goals for 2021. I'm getting my
master's in cybersecurity in May, so after that I want to hit the ground running
on all this. And while not tech-related, I also want to learn another language
(not programming lol). I've spent some time on Duolingo lately learning
Japanese, and I'm hoping to be able to carry a conversation by the end of the
year.

That's all for now, see ya! ðŸ‘‹
