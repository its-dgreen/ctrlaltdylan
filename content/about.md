title: About Me
---

A page about me on my website created by me. Neato.

I'm a software engineer living in Rocket City AL with my lovely wife. Haven't
been here for too long, but it's been pretty enjoyable so far. Pretty good food,
even better beer.

I currently work at Sangoma, where I work on a team of engineers managing and
maintaining cloud infrastructure and applications.

I like doing web development, I'm pretty into working with Ruby and Rails. You
can also find me using tools like Node, React, MongoDB, and React Native. Also
like cloud stuff, specifically AWS and Heroku, and occassionally Firebase

Outside of computer-y stuff, I like to cook... a lot. Also pretty into beer,
Nintendo games, playing synthesizer and bass, and playing with my dog. You can
find pictures of him on my Twitter, he's a good boy.
