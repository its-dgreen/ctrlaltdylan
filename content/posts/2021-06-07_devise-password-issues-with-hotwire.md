title: 'Devise Reset Password Issues with Hotwire'

  'I recently ran into an issue with Devise password resets and Hotwire'
---

The last Rails app I created, [OurGroceries](https://github.com/thisisdylandev/ourgroceries), was made to mess around with and learn Hotwire. Hotwire is by far a super nift and amazing piece of technology, used to create reactive and real-time applications in Rails without the need for a SPA/SPA-like JavaScript Framework.  OurGroceries is super simple, and honestly HotWire is probably overkill for it, but it was a learning project, not some fancy SaaS app I'm trying to make money off of.

However, when I was close to the finish line, I ran into a very odd error, I couldn't get the password reset form to work. I would follow the link generated in the email, type in a new password, then nothing changes, and I would still be on the reset password form page with the form still filled out. The following errors would be in the logs:

```

I wound up posting on the rails subreddit, and some wonderful stranger pointed me in the right direction. They stated: `That 'as TURBO_STREAM' pops out at me. I'm not sure how Devise and Turbo play together` and linked me to a StackOverflow post that I somehow missed in all my hours of googling. 

The fix was super straightforward and simple, it's actually a [known issue with Devise with a PR open for it](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/pull/5340). All I needed to do was add `html: {'data-turbo' => "false"}` to the `form_for` in the forms that were giving me problems, and then everything started working! 

This is my first blog post on trying to explain a fix or technical issue, so I'd love feedback! Hit me up on the twitters at [@thisisdylandev](https://twitter.com/thisisdylandev)

Well, that's all for now ðŸ‘‹
